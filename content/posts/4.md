New day, so I wanted to talk about another game I finished: *Stellar Blade*.

This is one of those games, that you suck at but enjoy nonetheless, this game was amazing, the voice acting was just *chef's kiss* (in Korean atleast, not sure about the other languages on that).

The game loop was **brutal**, each enemy usually having its own quirk really had me  nearly breaking my controller everytime. Though it was hard the satisfaction I got from beating the enemies cannot be understated.

Next the **open world** aspect of the game was well executed, it did feel a bit repetitive at times but it wasn't empty like some of the other games I've tried (looking at you Metroid Prime 4).

The sound design was amazing too, the music really brought everything together. The enemies *felt alive* which was horrifying at times, when you're being run down by a whole bunch of them.

That's about all I have to say about the game, it's not a *must play*, but it will keep you engaged throughout.

I'm going to play Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch next, hope I'll be able to enjoy that too.

*Au Revoir*,
