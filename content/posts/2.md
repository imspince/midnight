Early start today, I wanted to talk about how I feel about rhythm games. 

My opinion is very biased because of me liking songs **a lot**, but man some of the rhythm games I've been jamming to have been amazing.

I'll be talking about Unbeatable today. I finished it at the start of the year but it has stuck with me the most and I've played a ton of games this year.

It had incredible art direction, writing and obviously sound design, this game wasn't long, it was a short game of about 9 hours. But these 9 hours were a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly because the whole band Unbeatable and Beat's chemistry with the rest of the band is such a fun time, and leaving them after seeing their hardships broke me, though it might not have been as awe-inspiring for others as the gameplay was buggy for some people, it was okay for me personally though.

I will never rate games on a scale, since every game has its merits, but if I did, this would be up there.

I got the album from bandcamp too and that's been an absolute blast.

I'll let y'all know how it goes,

bieee,
