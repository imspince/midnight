This is pretty new to me, so please bear with me.  

Anyways I'm going to be mostly blogging about **games** (especially JRPGs), **anime**, and **music**.

Since this is the first post, I'll just be talking about a game I'm playing at the moment: **Persona 5 Royal**.

I've gotten about **80 hours** in the game — it's an **impeccable** masterpiece. Coming from *Persona 3 Reload*, I have to say even though this game is older, it still stacks up against the latest entries. The **art style** is really fun, and my biggest positive is the **world building**.

Even though it's not exactly open world, every explorable area feels *lived in*. I'm not Japanese, but I'd also say some themes are pretty realistic to how life would be in Japan.  

Hopefully I'm able to make more posts about this series.

Cya,
