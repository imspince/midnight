Not even a whole day has passed, but I wanted to share something else I **love a lot**: *Vocaloid music*.

I've been playing **Colorful Stage** for a few days now, and I have to say this is one of the **best rhythm games**, period. Obviously, there might be better games in terms of *story*, *world-building*, etc., but it doesn’t get any easier while still being as **good in gameplay** as this.

There are a few things in particular I love about this game, mostly the **gameplay**. It’s nothing we haven’t seen before, with mechanics similar to other games such as *Piano Tiles*, but the **implementation is wonderful**.

Now, to talk about my *favourite Vocaloid song* at the moment, it has to be **Chinozo’s _Goodbye Declaration_**. Just an **absolute banger**.

I have other rhythm games downloaded too; I’ll let y'all know if I like those.
