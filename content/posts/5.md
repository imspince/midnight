Nearly forgot to post today, but that doesn't mean I *won't* try my best to get it out before midnight.

Today, I wanna talk about something which I have mentioned the past few days, but haven't really gone too deep into: **OSTs** *(Original Soundtracks)*.

This is a really important aspect for me since I'm an avid listener of music of all kinds and especially need proper audio mastering, not because I'm an audiophile(even though I am an audio snob sometimes), it's because I'm a very emotional person when it comes to consuming art of all kinds, so music kind of makes or destroys how good the work feels to me.

Now, that said I want to touch on a series I've been talking about a lot lately too: **Persona**, particularly Persona 3 Reload. This is kind of a retrospective on the music for me, This game has one of the best remixes in the history of OSTs, it takes what feels amazing in the originals and enhances it tenfold.

A song in particular I really like is *Memories of You*, this song is perfect to me, everything from the chorus to the bridge that leads to the amazing payoff towards the end of the song and serves as a such an emotional tug of the heart strings, it would be a crime not to talk about it.

This game if not for anything else, needs to be in the hall of fame for its impeccable OST album, though that's just my personal opinion which I'm sure many people will not agree with.

Tomorrow I'll be talking about art in the world of games, and breaking down the art direction of a game I like.

*Ciao*,
