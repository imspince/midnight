This is pretty new to me, so please bear with me. Anyways I'm going to be mostly blogging about games especially JRPGS, anime and music.

Since this is the first post I'll just be talking about a game I'm playing at the moment; Persona 5 Royal.

I've gotten about 80 hours in the game, it's an impeccable game, with the biggest  coming from Persona 3 Reload I have to say even though this game is older it still stacks up against the latest game, the art style is really fun. My biggest positive for this game is the world building. Even though this game is not exactly open world, every explorable area feels lived in, I'm not Japanese but I would also say some themes are pretty realistic to how it would be in Japan, being a weeaboo is amazing to me.

Hopefully I'm able to make more posts about this Series.

Cya,
